# RP2040
As an introduction to the project, my advisor and I thought it best to start slow. So, rather than start with the raspberry pi 4B, I began this project with the Feather RP2040. It is a very small and simple chip and is able to help me figure out the basics before I start tackling the much more complicated and powerful raspberry pi. To prep the chip I had to learn how to soldier the header pins in order to connect it to a bread board so that I could easily make secure connections to the RP2040. In this directory, you can find the code that I used on the RP2040 to switch a relay open and closed.
